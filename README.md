# PPY (PHP-Python) Compiler

A custom templating language compiler that combines HTML with embedded Python code, similar to PHP but using Python syntax.

## Overview

PPY is a templating language that allows you to embed Python code directly into HTML files. It uses a syntax similar to PHP but executes Python code instead. The compiler converts `.ppy` files into executable Python scripts that generate HTML output.

## Features

- **Embedded Python Code**: Use `<py? ... ?>` blocks to embed Python code
- **Variable Interpolation**: Use `<?= variable ?>` syntax for easy variable output
- **Loop Support**: Automatic indentation handling for Python loops and control structures
- **HTML Generation**: Converts templates to Python scripts that output HTML
- **Command Line Interface**: Simple CLI for compiling `.ppy` files

## Syntax

### Python Code Blocks
```html
<py?
# Python code goes here
for i in range(5):
    # Your Python logic
?>
```

### Variable Output
```html
<?= variable_name ?>
```

### Mixed Example
```html
<py?
for i in range(1, 6):
?>
    <p>Item number: <?= i ?></p>
<py?
# end loop
?>
```

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system
2. Clone or download this project
3. Build the compiler:
   ```bash
   go build -o ppy-compiler main.go
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Compile and output to console
./ppy-compiler -i input.ppy

# Compile to a specific output file
./ppy-compiler -i input.ppy -o output.py

# Alternative syntax (positional argument)
./ppy-compiler input.ppy
```

### Running the Generated Python Code
After compilation, run the generated Python file:
```bash
python output.py
```

## Example

### Input File (`index.ppy`)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Multiplication Table</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Multiplication Table</h1>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Ã—</th>
            <py?
            for i in range(1, 11):
            ?>
                <th><?= i ?></th>
            <py?
            # end headers loop
            ?>
        </tr>
        <py?
        for row in range(1, 11):
        ?>
            <tr>
                <th><?= row ?></th>
                <py?
                for col in range(1, 11):
                    product = row * col
                ?>
                    <td><?= product ?></td>
                <py?
                # end column loop
                ?>
            </tr>
        <py?
        # end row loop
        ?>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

### Generated Python Code
The compiler converts the above into Python print statements with proper indentation handling for loops and variable interpolation.

## How It Works

1. **Parsing**: The compiler uses regular expressions to identify Python code blocks (`<py? ... ?>`) and variable expressions (`<?= ... ?>`)
2. **Code Generation**: HTML content is converted to Python print statements
3. **Indentation Handling**: The compiler automatically manages Python indentation for loops and control structures
4. **Variable Interpolation**: Variable expressions are converted to string concatenation in print statements

## Command Line Options

- `-i <file>`: Input PPY file path (required)
- `-o <file>`: Output Python file path (optional, defaults to console output)

## Error Handling

The compiler provides clear error messages for:
- Missing input files
- File read/write errors
- Invalid command line arguments
